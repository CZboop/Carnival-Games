# Carnival-Games :balloon:
Tkinter application with several carnival game and penny arcade inspired tabs

Love Tester :two_hearts: - based on The Simpsons' version of this classic arcade machine

Guess How Many Smarties in the Jar :candy: - no maths required, it's semi-random and almost certainly not the real number in there

Fortune Teller :crystal_ball: - a sentient fortune cookie gives you wise words that may or may not make sense

Pop the Balloon :dart: - throw a dart at some balloons and something may happen




Here's a couple of the better looking tabs in action:
